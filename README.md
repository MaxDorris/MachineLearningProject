# Conclusion:

One drawback of the Great-Circle Distance used in the pgeocode.haversine_distance(x,y) method for categorizing coordinates by their zipcode is that zipcode boundary-lines are non-circular and non-uniform, meaning that coordinates contained within a particularly irregular polygon may in fact be closer to the identifying "central" coordinate of another zipcode's polygon than they are to their own. Since we applied this method to each of our datasets before combining them, our data is only able to make predictions based on the approximate region.
