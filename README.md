# Determining Factors of Stroke

## A Data Analysis Project Created by Kayla Brown, Max Dorris, and Matthew Peach

### Project Overview
**Problem Statment:** What are the determining factors for strokes?

**Dataset:** We are using a set of data collected on over 5,000 patients that includes sex, age, hypertension, heart-disease, marital status, work type, type of residence, average blood glucose level (diabetes), body mass index, and historical smoking data.  Each patient was also evaluated for whether they had a stroke.  

**Predictive Problem to Be Solved:** We are making a classification model to estimate key factors leading to a stroke by comparing the factors mentioned in the dataset with whether the patient had a stroke or not in order to see which factors align most closely with those who have experienced a stroke.  The model we plan to use will be a random forest.

**Materials:** To complete our project, we have used Tableau for our visualizations, Amazon Web Services to house our data in a database, and Python as the language for our machine learning model.  Within the model we have used several dependencies, including Pandas, ScikitLearn
