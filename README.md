# Determining Factors of Stroke

### A Data Analysis Project Created by Kayla Brown, Max Dorris, and Matthew Peach

# Deliverable One
### Project Idea
**Problem Solving:** We are examining determining factors of stroke based on health and environmental factors. 

**Dataset:** We are using a set of data collected on over 5,000 patients that includes sex, age, hypertension, heart-disease, marital status, work type, type of residence, average blood glucose level (diabetes), body mass index, and historical smoking data.

**Predictive Problem to Be Solved:** We are making a linear regression model to estimate key factors leading to a stroke by comparing the factors mentioned in the dataset with whether the patient had a stroke or not in order to see which factors align most closely with those who have experienced a stroke.

### ERD Diagram
At this point, the we are working with a single dataset, so we are not working with a database.

### Outline of Visualization Dashboard
Our plan for our dashboard is to use charts to show factors individually and as a group in order to display different risk factors for strokes.
Here are some initial ideas:

### Mockup of Machine Learning Model
We will create a linear regression determining key factors leading to a stroke to produce a risk score from key factors.  

#### Deliverable 1 requirements:
- Finalized project idea including what is your dataset, what are the problems you solving, and what will be the predictive problem you will solve.
- Create an ER diagram and setup database for your data (if applicable)
- Create an rough outline of your visualization dashboard.
- Create a paper based mockup of your machine learning model.
- Continue to use Github for all the data

#### Deliverable 2 requirements:
- A detailed README.md file that includes the project status, images, descriptions, and results
- First attempt of a machine learning model, including a confusion matrix and accuracy score (20 points)
- First attempt of a working dashboard
- Database that stores data for the project (if applicable)
- Draft of presentation (edited)
